# Zookeeper's Database Project

This tutorial will guide you through building an application to store, retrieve, and delete the names of different animals.

The project is broken down into 14 steps to help you learn along the way.

## Before Starting

You should:

- Have Python 3.x and IDLE installed
- Know how to create a new Python file
- Know how to open an existing Python file
- Know how to run a Python file

## The Requirements

Our application will be used by an imaginary zoo. They need a way to keep track of what animals they have.

The users of the application need to be able to:

- Show a list of animals currently at the zoo (in alphabetical order)
- Add a new animal to the list when a new animal is added to the zoo
- Remove an animal if it is no longer at the zoo
- Exit the application

The application should also:

- Save the list to a file when the application exits
- Load the list from a file when the application starts

This will be a text-based application controlled by keyboard input.

# Planning

Before building any application, it's important to understand the requirements, what the application is trying to achieve, and what it will look (and feel) like to the user.

To help you understand what the finished product will look like and how it will work, it is handy to look at the finished product. You can test the [web-based prototype](sample/jsanimals.html) and try it for yourself.

# Steps

- [1. Display a menu to the user](step1.md)
- [2. Ask the user for input](step2.md)
- [3. Take different actions based on user input](step3.md)
- [4. Loop back to the menu after taking an action](step4.md)
- [5. Create and sort a list](step5.md)
- [6. Create a function to display a list](step6.md)
- [7. Create a loop to display a list nicely](step7.md)
- [8. Display the total number of list items](step8.md)
- [9. Add new items to a list](step9.md)
- [10. Delete items from a list](step10.md)
- [11. Break the loop and exit the program](step11.md)
- [12. Import a library](step12.md)
- [13. Load list items from a JSON file](step13.md)
- [14. Save list items to a JSON file](step14.md)
